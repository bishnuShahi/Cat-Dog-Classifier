# Cat-Dog-Classifier
Used Convolution Neural Networks to implement the Cat-Dog-Classifier model and seamlessly integrated it with web framework  Django

The the model was too big to upload so, just run the cat_v_dogs_classification.ipynb file and it should generate a model named "models.h5". 
Also the dataset for this file will be downloaded from kaggle so you should create and download an active API from kaggle -> profile. Then paste
the 'kaggle.json' file here.

Also run the "python manage.py staticfiles" command, because I didnt upload the staticfiles folder here.
